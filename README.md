# hello-world

Hello hello! My name is Malini. I'm a sophomore at the University of California at Berkeley, and am excited to be taking the Intro to Python Class. I do not have too much expereince, but hope to learn a lot about coding in its many forms. In my free time, I like to read, listen to music, and watch TV shows and anime. Go Bears!
